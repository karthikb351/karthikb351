  <p style="font-size: smaller;"><i>In college and looking to get a job as a developer? Are you underrepresented in the tech industry? I'd like to help.</i></p>

  <h2>The college placement system today is broken</h2>
  <p>Universities lean more and more on GPA and aptitude tests to filter out candidates for companies instead of helping students learn what actual software development is like. The few students who do stand out during placements are usually those who worked on projects outside of their academics, usually with very little encouragement or support from universities. Like with everything else in the world, this too disproportionately impacts women and other minorities.</p>
  <p>I was fortunate to have had professors and friends who encouraged me to keep doing things outside of just exam preparations, and that was the single biggest factor in helping me get a head start when I graduated. Without getting too philosophical, I'm hoping this one small way of trying to pay that forward.</p>

  <h2>Okay so this is how I'm looking to be of use. On a ~weekly basis, I can:</h2>
  <ul id="password_block">
    <li>Talk through your project ideas (or help you think of one if don't know where to start)</li>
    <li>Review any code youâ€™ve written (or get someone to)</li>
    <li>Offer direction and guidance on your work</li>
    <li>Help you with visibility to companies outside of your college placement channels, including internships. (I obviously cannot promise anything here, so it is best effort)</li>
    <li>Offer a private and safe online space for you to share what you are working on, ask questions, and learn from your peers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you know anyone who you think this might be helpful to, let them know.</p>

  <h3>If you are a 2nd/3rd/4th year college student looking to work in tech, especially one who is a minority in the tech industry, please sign up below!</h3>
  <p><strong>Note: <i>I can't promise to help everyone who applies, but I will respond to everyone. I want to start with a small group as I'm still figuring this out as I go along. Some things might be rough around the edges so bear with me!</i></strong></p>
