  <h2>The college placement system today is broken</h2>
  <p>Universities lean more and more on GPA and aptitude tests to filter out candidates for companies instead of helping students learn what actual software development is like. The few students who do stand out during placements are usually those who worked on projects outside of academics inspite of very little encouragement and support from universities. This lack of encouragement is disproportionately so in the case of women and other minorities in the tech industry.</p>
  <p>I’m one of the lucky ones who had professors and friends who encouraged me to keep doing things outside of academics, and I'm very grateful for that. I’d like to pay it forward by trying to be useful to others.</p>

  <h2>I’d like to take some time out every week to:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Talk through your project ideas (or help you think of one if don't know where to start)</li>
    <li>Review any code you’ve written (or get someone to)</li>
    <li>Offer direction and guidance on your work</li>
    <li>Help you with visibility to companies outside of your college placement channels, including internships</li>
    <li>Offer a private, online space for you to share what you are working on, ask questions, and learn from your peers</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you know anyone who you think this might be helpful to, please do share this with them.</p>

  <p><strong>Note: <i>I can't promise to help everyone who applies, but I will respond to everyone. I want to start with a small group as I'm still figuring this out as I go along. Some things might be rough around the edges so bear with me!</i></strong></p>
