Today is my first day at [Insider](https://insider.in) and after nearly three years at HasGeek - the first and only company I've worked at before this - it's awfully bittersweet to write this.

I could not have found a better place to work at straight out of college. Nearly every opportunity I've gotten (and projects I've been involved with) can be traced back to HasGeek in some way.

I owe [Kiran](https://twitter.com/jackerhack) and [Zainab](https://twitter.com/zainabbawa) immensely for giving me a chance then and for constantly backing me over the past three years.

Of all the things I love about HasGeek, the one that I think is the rarest is the unyielding set of principles under which Kiran and Zainab operate the company. You'd be hard pressed to find a company that tries harder to be as fair and open as possible.

That said, looking back at the last three years at HasGeek, I realized that I need to try something new - just for the sake of something new, if not anything else.

### What I'm doing at Insider

Insider is an online ticketing and events platform that's very curated. Part of my job is going to be working on their engineering team across their tech stack (which is largely in JavaScript).

The more interesting part of my job is to help build out organizer and community tools on Insider.

Having spend three years working for in tech conferences, starting and running a board game community, and doing a monthly puzzle event, a couple of things have become very obvious to me.

**One is that independent organizers** - i.e. those who run non-commercial events (or do it part-time) - **have no tools in India to support them in a sustainable way.** 

Communities in India today are largely on Facebook groups, WhatsApp groups, and Meetup.com - and none of these platforms allow organizers to make things sustainable (or even profitable). The amount of money and time they put into running the community far exceeds anything they can recover from it.

There are ticketing platforms like Townscript, Explara, etc to help organizers run paid events - but they all suffer from the same problem - they aren't the place the community _is_, and the high fees they charge provides little-to-no value if all they do is ticketing.

**The second issue for organizers** in my experience is that there is **no one "home" for an online community in India.** Organizers may operate on just one or two social media platforms because of the overhead in managing more than that, and it's a problem because by doing so, they automatically eliminate all the people who are elsewhere.

**The third and most important problem in opinion, is that there is very little discoverability of these communities.**

Three years doing tech events and two years doing board games, and we still rely on word of mouth or traditional marketing channels to reach new people.

Meetup.com seems to push people to join as many groups as possible, irrespective of how interested they are and that's not great because now organizers have a false sense of size.

Here's an example from our board game community (which has had a weekly event for the past 82 weeks on Meetup.com)

### Where Insider and I fit in

Insider is _extremely_ well suited for that third problem - discoverability. Having done the hard work of getting music, comedy (and even some IPL) tickets on the platform, there are lot of users on Insider just looking for the next interesting thing to do in their city.

It's easy to see the value for a small community organizer to find herself listed next to, say, Rohan Joshi and Zakir Khan's comedy show.

The value proposition for Insider in this equation is simple - there is very little stickiness to people who buy tickets for music gigs, comedy shows, and IPL - they'll just move to the next platform that sells those tickets.

Insider's pitch is that you'll come for the Prateek Kuhad show, but stay for that [amazing photography walk](https://insider.in/the-photography-walk-may1-2018/event) you found.

For community organizers, I'm also hoping to build out some simple tools to make your lives easier - whether that's maintaining a mailing list, managing RSVPs, charging for events, and having a central online hub for your community that you can point people to.

Your Facebook/WhatsApp/Meetup groups aren't going away anytime soon, but maybe this can help supplement them.

If you are a community/event organizer and these problems seem to ring a bell, I'd love to chat! You can find me on Twitter at [@karthikb351](https://twitter.com/karthikb351) or just shoot me a mail at [karthik@insider.in](mailto:karthik@insider.in).

  
I'm excited!
