description: Let's solve some programming puzzles together every week!

---
### Context

I've been streaming on Twitch ([@karthikb351](https://twitter.com/karthikb351)) for a few weeks now, and I finally think I'm in a position to take on a slightly more complicated project - building a small programming community!

## TL;DR

> A Discord server that's for folks who want to spend some time every week working on some simple programming challenges/puzzles, and then discussing them with others. Specifically designed for people both new to and experienced in programming.

## What kind of challenges/puzzles?

I've been a [huge fan of advent of code](https://karthikbalakrishnan.com/blog/how-advent-of-code-made-me-love-competitive-programming-again) for years now, so that's the logical place for me to start. We'll start off with puzzles from [AOC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)


More details to follow, but of you want to get started you should probably join the Discord at [discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H](https/://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H).
