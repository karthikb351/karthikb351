Let's solve some programming puzzles together every week.

### Context

I've been streaming on Twitch ([@karthikb351](https://twitter.com/karthikb351)) for a few weeks now, and I finally think I'm in a position to take on a slightly more complicated project - building a small programming community!

## TL;DR

> A Discord server that's for folks who want to spend some time every week working on some simple programming challenges/puzzles, and then discussing them with others. Specifically designed for people new to (and experienced in) programming. Discord: [discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H](https/://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H).

## Who is this for?

* If you are someone who has some basic understanding of a programming language, these problems are going to be more logic challenges than something where the code is complicated.
* If you are something who codes for their day job, this is a great oppurtunity so spend a few minutes every week to work on some fun puzzles, and explore solutions from other people. I personally have found these sorts of programming problems to be a welcome change of pace from what I usually do at work (which, let's face it, is ultimately 99% just writing  CRUD apps).



## What kind of challenges/puzzles?

I've been a [huge fan of advent of code](https://karthikbalakrishnan.com/blog/how-advent-of-code-made-me-love-competitive-programming-again) for years now, so that's the logical place for me to start. We'll start off with puzzles from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).


## How to participate

More details to follow, but if you want to get started you should probably join the Discord at [discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H](https/://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H).
