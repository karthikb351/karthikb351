Let's solve some programming puzzles together every week.

### Context

I've been streaming on Twitch ([@karthikb351](https://twitter.com/karthikb351)) for a few weeks now, and I finally think I'm in a position to take on a slightly more complicated project - building a small programming community!

## TL;DR

> A Discord server that's for folks who want to spend some time every week working on some simple programming challenges/puzzles, and then discussing them with others. Specifically designed for people new to (and experienced in) programming. Discord: [discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H](https://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H).

## Who is this for?

* If you are someone who has some basic understanding of a programming language, these problems are going to be more logic challenges than something where the code is complicated.
* If you are something who codes for their day job, this is a great oppurtunity to spend a few minutes every week to work on some fun puzzles, and explore solutions from other people. I personally have found these sorts of programming problems to be a welcome change of pace from what I usually do at work (which, let's face it, is ultimately 99% just writing  CRUD apps).
* If you've been meaning to pick up a new langauge, or explore a new programming paradigm, this is a great excuse to finally do it. The problems are simple enough that you could possibly do it in an new langauge if you wanted to.

## What kind of challenges/puzzles?

I've been a [huge fan of advent of code](https://karthikbalakrishnan.com/blog/how-advent-of-code-made-me-love-competitive-programming-again) for years now, so that's the logical place for me to start. We'll start off with puzzles from [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## How to participate

> Best place to start is to probably join the Discord at [discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H](https://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H).

* We're doing 5 puzzles/week (so 5 weeks to finish Advent of Code 2020's 25 puzzles).
* Discussions and solutions are posted on the `#advent-of-code-chat` channel on [the Discord](https://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H).
* Experienced programmers should try and set some additional contraints/challenges, like solving the puzzles in a new language.
* If you are new to programming, the puzzles are largely logical, and not very complicated to code. You can use the `#programming-help` channel on [the Discord](https://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H) if you find yourself stuck somewhere.
* We have a private leaderboard that you can join to track progress against the other members
* Create a GitHub repo, say hi on [the Discord](https://discord.gg/NvwRKJDG8H), and hopefully learn something new!
