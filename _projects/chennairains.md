  A rapid-response crowdsourced site in response to the floods in Chennai.

Along with a few others, [ChennaiRains.org](http://chennairains.org) was setup within a few hours of the floods starting, around 2am. It started with just a handful of people and grew to over 200 volunteers in 3 days. In addition to building the website and supporting tech, I helped setup the communications channels and tools to manage all the data and volunteers. It was a combination of Slack and Google Spreadsheets that powered the whole campaign, with some scripting to glue it all together.
