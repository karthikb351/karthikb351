  A service and app I worked on while at college to help students at VIT University keep track of their attendance and academics
---
It is full fledged product for students to manage their academics. It was initially built with on Google App Engine(Python) but we quickly outgrew that, so we moved to Node.js + MongoDB hosted on Heroku. We also built native client apps for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.karthikb351.vitinfo2&hl=en), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/vitacademics/id727796987?mt=8) and [Windows Phone](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/vitacademics-8-1/d6a9e028-4cc2-46ea-9f1b-84c02f4ae408). As well as a [Web App](https://vitacademics-web.herokuapp.com/) and even an [SMS interface](http://vitacademics-rel.herokuapp.com/api/txtweb).

All the applications were developed in parallel and backed by a single, versioned and [well documented](https://github.com/aneesh-neelam/VITacademics/wiki/JSON-API) REST API.
