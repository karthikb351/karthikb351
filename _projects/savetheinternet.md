I was involved with the campaign from the beginning, helping build the tech that supported the movement.

The entire stack cost us **exactly zero**. It was built entirely on free tools and services, and managed to handle over 2 million visitors over a span of just 14 days.

I spoke about [How we ran #SaveTheInternet](https://speakerdeck.com/karthikb351/how-we-ran-number-savetheinternet-for-free-1) for free at Barcamp Bangalore in 2015.
